        <h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>
        <p>
            HTML <em>(Hypertext Markup Language)</em>is used to create document
            on the <u>World Wide Web.</u>
            <em
                >It is simply a collection of certain key words called "Tags"
                that are helpful in writing the document to be displayed using a
                browser on Internet.</em
            >
            HTML was developed by <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> in 1992.
